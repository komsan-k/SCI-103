# LAB 08: VPython Simulation ‚Äî Traveling Wave on a String  

## üéØ Objectives
- To visualize a **traveling sinusoidal wave** on a string using VPython.  
- To understand the mathematical form of a traveling wave:
  \[ y(x,t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t) \]
- To observe how **wave speed, frequency, and wavelength** affect the motion of the string.  
- To develop computational skills by implementing a physics concept in Python.

## üìñ Background Theory

A **traveling wave** on a string can be described as:
\[ y(x,t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t) \]
where:  
- A = amplitude (maximum displacement),  
- k = 2œÄ/Œª = wave number,  
- œâ = 2œÄf = angular frequency,  
- Œª = wavelength,  
- f = frequency,  
- v = œâ/k = wave speed.  

This equation describes a **sinusoidal disturbance** that moves without changing shape along the +x-direction. VPython allows us to **animate the displacement of points on the string** to simulate this wave.

## üõ† Materials and Software
- Python 3.x  
- VPython library (`vpython`) installed (`pip install vpython`)  
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## üß™ Experimental Procedure

1. **Define Parameters**  
   - Set amplitude A, wavelength Œª, frequency f.  
   - Compute angular frequency œâ = 2œÄf and wave number k = 2œÄ/Œª.  

2. **Initialize the String**  
   - Represent the string as a set of points along the x-axis using VPython‚Äôs `curve` object.  

3. **Update Wave Motion**  
   - For each time step, compute the displacement y(x,t) of each point.  
   - Update the curve to animate the traveling wave.  

4. **Run Simulation**  
   - Observe how the wave propagates with time.  
   - Experiment with different values of amplitude, wavelength, and frequency.

## üíª VPython Code Example

```python
from vpython import *  # provides vector, curve, sin, cos, pi, rate, color

scene.title = "Traveling Wave on a String (no NumPy)"
scene.background = color.white

# Parameters
A   = 1.0      # amplitude (m)
lam = 4.0      # wavelength (m)
f   = 1.0      # frequency (Hz)
k   = 2*pi/lam # wave number
omega = 2*pi*f # angular frequency
v = omega/k    # wave speed (not used directly, shown for reference)

L = 20.0       # string length (m)
N = 200        # points
dx = L/(N-1)

# Build x samples as a plain list (no numpy)
x_vals = [i*dx for i in range(N)]

# Create the string
string = curve(color=color.blue, radius=0.05)
for x in x_vals:
    string.append(vector(x, 0, 0))

t = 0.0
dt = 0.02

while True:
    rate(50)
    t += dt
    for i in range(N):
        x = x_vals[i]
        y = A * sin(k*x - omega*t)
        string.modify(i, vector(x, y, 0))

```

## üìä Observations
- The wave moves along the **+x-axis** with constant speed.  
- Changing **amplitude** modifies the maximum displacement.  
- Changing **wavelength** modifies how many peaks appear along the string.  
- Changing **frequency** modifies how fast the wave oscillates.  

---

## üìù Analysis
1. Measure the wave speed from the simulation and compare it with:
   \[ v = \frac{\omega}{k} \]
2. Verify that doubling the frequency doubles the wave speed if wavelength is held constant.  
3. Investigate what happens if both Œª and f are changed while keeping v constant.

## ‚ùì Post-Lab Questions
1. What is the mathematical form of the wave you simulated?  
2. How does the wavelength affect the appearance of the wave?  
3. If frequency is doubled, what happens to the wave speed and wave profile?
4. 4. In real strings (like a guitar string), what physical factors determine wave speed?
<!-- 4. How could you modify the simulation to represent a **standing wave**? -->

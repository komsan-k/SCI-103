# LAB 09: VPython Simulation ‚Äî Standing Wave on a String  

## üéØ Objectives
- To simulate a **standing wave** on a string using VPython.  
- To understand the mathematical form of a standing wave:  
  \[ y(x,t) = 2A \sin(kx) \cos(\omega t) \]  
- To observe **nodes** (points of no displacement) and **antinodes** (points of maximum displacement).  
- To explore the relation between wavelength, frequency, and harmonic modes in standing waves.

## üìñ Background Theory

A **standing wave** is formed by the superposition of two identical traveling waves moving in opposite directions:  
\[ y_1(x,t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t), \quad y_2(x,t) = A \sin(kx + \omega t) \]

Adding these gives:  
\[ y(x,t) = y_1 + y_2 = 2A \sin(kx)\cos(\omega t) \]

Where:  
- A = amplitude of each traveling wave,  
- k = 2œÄ/Œª = wave number,  
- œâ = 2œÄf = angular frequency,  
- Œª = wavelength,  
- f = frequency.  

**Nodes:** occur at sin(kx) = 0 ‚Üí zero displacement.  
**Antinodes:** occur at sin(kx) = ¬±1 ‚Üí maximum displacement.  

In a string of length L fixed at both ends, allowed wavelengths are:  
\[ \lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}, \quad n = 1,2,3,... \]

## üõ† Materials and Software
- Python 3.x  
- VPython library (`vpython`) installed (`pip install vpython`)  
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## üß™ Experimental Procedure
1. **Set Parameters**: Choose amplitude A, string length L, frequency f, and mode number n.  
2. **Compute Wave Properties**: Calculate wavelength Œª = 2L/n, wave number k = 2œÄ/Œª, and angular frequency œâ = 2œÄf.  
3. **Model the String**: Use VPython‚Äôs `curve` to create discrete points along the x-axis.  
4. **Update with Standing Wave Equation**: For each time step, update displacement y(x,t) = 2A sin(kx)cos(œât).  
5. **Observe**: Identify nodes and antinodes, and compare with theory.

## üíª VPython Code Example

```python
from vpython import *
import numpy as np

# Scene setup
scene.title = "Standing Wave on a String"
scene.width = 900
scene.height = 400
scene.background = color.white

# Parameters
A = 1.0        # Amplitude (m)
L = 20.0       # Length of string (m)
n = 2          # Mode number (harmonic)
f = 1.0        # Frequency (Hz)

lam = 2*L/n                # Wavelength
k = 2*np.pi/lam            # Wave number
omega = 2*np.pi*f          # Angular frequency

N = 200                    # Number of points
x_vals = np.linspace(0, L, N)

# Create string
string = curve(color=color.blue, radius=0.05)
for x in x_vals:
    string.append(vector(x, 0, 0))

t = 0
dt = 0.02

# Animation loop
while True:
    rate(50)
    t += dt
    for i, x in enumerate(x_vals):
        y = 2*A*np.sin(k*x)*np.cos(omega*t)
        string.modify(i, vector(x, y, 0))
```

## üìä Observations
- The wave exhibits **fixed ends** at x = 0 and x = L (nodes).  
- **Antinodes** oscillate with maximum amplitude.  
- Increasing **mode number n** increases the number of nodes and antinodes.  
- Frequency determines how fast the string oscillates, while mode number determines its shape.

## üìù Analysis
1. Verify that the simulated standing wave satisfies:  
   \[ y(x,t) = 2A \sin(kx)\cos(\omega t) \]  
2. Count the number of nodes and compare with n+1 (including both ends).  
3. Verify that wavelength matches Œª = 2L/n.  
4. Explore the relationship between f, L, and the mode number n.

## ‚ùì Post-Lab Questions
1. What is the difference between a traveling wave and a standing wave?  
2. How do nodes and antinodes form in a standing wave?  
3. For n=3, how many nodes and antinodes should you observe?  
4. If the string length doubles, how does the fundamental frequency change?  
5. How can standing waves explain the behavior of musical instruments (e.g., guitar, violin)?

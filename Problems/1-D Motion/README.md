# ðŸšš Truck Motion Simulation with VPython

## ðŸ“– Problem Statement  

A truck is moving along a straight road. It starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at **2.00 m/sÂ²** until it reaches a speed of **20.0 m/s**. After reaching this speed, the truck continues to travel at a constant velocity of **20.0 m/s** for **20.0 s**. Finally, the brakes are applied, and the truck decelerates uniformly to rest in **5.00 s**.  

### Tasks  
1. **Determine the total time of motion of the truck.**  
2. **Calculate the total displacement of the truck during the motion.**  
3. **Find the average velocity of the truck for the entire journey.**  
4. **Using VPython, simulate the motion of the truck with a simple animation, showing the phases of acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration.**

## ðŸ§® Analytical Results  

## ðŸ§® Analytical Results  

```text
- Time to accelerate:  
  t_accel = v/a = 20/2 = 10 s

- Total time of motion:  
  T = t_accel + t_cruise + t_brake = 10 + 20 + 5 = 35 s

- Displacements:  
  - Acceleration phase:  
    s1 = 0.5 * a * t^2 = 0.5 * 2 * 10^2 = 100 m  
  - Constant velocity:  
    s2 = v * t = 20 * 20 = 400 m  
  - Braking phase:  
    s3 = 0.5 * (v+0) * t = 0.5 * 20 * 5 = 50 m  

- Total displacement:  
  S = s1 + s2 + s3 = 100 + 400 + 50 = 550 m

- Average velocity:  
  v_avg = S / T = 550 / 35 â‰ˆ 15.7 m/s


## ðŸ’» VPython Minimal Animation Code  

```python
# GlowScript VPython 3.2
from vpython import *

# --- Parameters ---
a1 = 2.0
vmax = 20.0
t_cruise = 20.0
t_brake = 5.0

t_accel = vmax / a1
T = t_accel + t_cruise + t_brake
a3 = -vmax / t_brake

# --- Scene ---
road = box(pos=vec(0,-0.1,0), size=vec(120,0.05,4), color=color.gray(0.7))
truck = box(pos=vec(-55,0,0), size=vec(2,1,1), color=color.orange)

# --- Simulation ---
t, x, v = 0, 0, 0
dt = 0.01

while t < T:
    rate(100)
    if t < t_accel:
        a = a1
    elif t < t_accel + t_cruise:
        a = 0
    else:
        a = a3
    v = v + a*dt
    x = x + v*dt
    truck.pos = vec(-55 + x/5, 0, 0)
    t += dt
